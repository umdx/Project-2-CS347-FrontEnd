# Itemized Breakdown

1. This website / application was created to act as a fun throwback to our childhood days of playing Pokemon. The website is meant to search for a wide range of Pokemon names and display a sprite to the user. The user can then add that Pokemon and a description of it to a database. The user can freely delete, add, update, etc to the database.

2. The Pokedex has both a back-end store and front-end client, both linked in github.

3. The front-end uses many different components and hooks. Ex) The AddPokemon component, the PokemonList component, and so on.

4. The content of the client does change, when a user searches for a Pokemon the user will either be displayed with a unknown pokemon or the pokemon of their choosing.

5. The client state is indeed managed with Redux, react-redux, and redux.

6. The user interface is responsive in design and visually appealing for its topic.

7. The client is free of all warnings and errors.

8. The front-end client is stored in a Github repository.

9. The app stores data long-term in a relational database.

10. Express based web services is provided in the backend portion of the project, also linked in the backend github repository.

11. The end points of the web service and parameters are appropriatley named.

12. The back-end is stored in a separate Git repository.
